          <header>The Setting</header>
          <p>Magic has always been here, deep in the world, hiding. The traditions stretch back millennia, but the otherworldly <em>anima</em> required to perform real magic have been dying out, and fewer magicians are born every year. A person paired with an <em>anima</em> is empowered to do one particular breed of magic. Although some claim Merlin had paired with a dozen <em>anima</em>, no one is sure they believe those stories: in living memory no one has ever had more than one.</p>
         <p>But as the totalitarian government spread west, the set-upon tribes gathered. Their Ghost Dance tore open the ley lines of the world. The <em>anima</em>, suddenly free to cross once again from their reality into our own, returned in force, and magic came roaring back.</p>
          <hr/>
          <p>Seattle, 1902. A city still emerging from the frontier. The far-away government struggles to maintain their control, fighting the never-ending, low-simmering war against the tribes. The church calls to end the witchcraft that has taken root in the world. And a budding revolution swells from the Underground.</p>

          <p>This is a <a href='https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/530352392/cortex-prime-a-multi-genre-modular-roleplaying-gam'>Cortex Prime</a> game. We find that Cortex pushes the characters into interesting places and makes them develop a complex, fun story that's always evolving. Our <a href='http://calville.thestorysofar.link'>previous Cortex game</a> ran for years, and we only stopped that one because we burned out our <abbr title='read as "GM" or "DM" if you must'>Master of Ceremonies</abbr>. So this game is GMful, and using the following mods:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Core traits are Values (with statements), Relationships (with statements), and Distinctions. We're ex-Smallville and it shows.</li>
            <li>Additional traits are Powers (with power sets), Extras, and Locations.</li>
            <li>We are using a Doom Pool, but are allowing ourselves to convert spoilers into Doom Pool dice or Complications as we feel is appropriate</li>
            <li>We are using the Effect Die</li>
            <li>Plot points carry over from session to session, but if you have fewer than 2 you get 2 to start</li>
            <li>We used Pathways to do chargen, using a blend of the Cortex Prime rules and the Smallville rules, because we liked the more interesting connection drawing that was available in Smallville.</li>
            <li>We are using Milestones for character advancement, with each character having their own 1xp/3xp/10xp goals, and with everyone having access to two "shared milestones" that encourage getting hurt and helping those who are hurt</li>
            <li>Scene framing is performed by whoever is first to toss a Plot Point onto the table and call the next scene. If a scene ends and no one has claimed the next one, whoever frames the next scene gets a Plot Point instead.</li>
            <li>If you frame a scene that you're not in, you have to spend an extra Plot Point</li>
          </ul>
