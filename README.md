# What is Gateway?

Gateway is a [Cortex Prime][cprime] RPG being played by a group of players in Southern California. The setting is an alt-history Seattle just after the 1900s where magic has recently reawakened, and is being used by both sides of a budding resistance against the totalitarian regime. The characters come from all sides the conflict.

# Why does an RPG campaign need a code repository?

This codebase creates the [website][site] that chronicles the campaign. A slightly-cleaned up transcript is made of each session that becomes another episode in the ongoing saga of the game. The website lets our players– and those following along at home– remember the details that otherwise get forgotten.
